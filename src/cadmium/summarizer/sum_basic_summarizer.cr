  # SumBasic (Nenkova and Vanderwende, 2005) is a system that produces generic multi-document summaries.
  # Its  design  is  motivated  by  the  observation  that  terms  occurring  frequently  in  the  document  cluster  occur with higher probability in the human summaries than words occurring less frequently.
  # Step 1 : Calculate the probability ( = normalized ratio) of each term in the document.
  # Step 2 : Calculate for each sentence in the document a rating equals to the average probability of the terms in the sentence.
  # Step 3 : Pick the best scoring sentence that contains the highest probability word.
  # Step 4 : For each term in the sentence chosen at step 3, update their probability (probabilityÂ²)
  # Step 5 : If the desired summary length has not been reached, go back to Step 2
