Cadmium is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) library for Crystal. Included are classes and modules for tokenizing, inflecting, stemming, and creating n-grams with much more to come.

For full API documentation check out [the docs](https://cadmiumcr.github.io/cadmium/).

For more complete and up to date information about specific parts of Cadmium, check out each relevant shard repository.

## Installation

Your project *should* only include the cadmium shard(s) you need.

However, in case you want to test out **all of Cadmium** in a simple way, you can install all modules of the project in a few lines.

Add this to your application's `shard.yml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  cadmium:
    github: cadmiumcr/cadmium
    branch: master
```
